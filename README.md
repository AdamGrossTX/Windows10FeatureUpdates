# Windows 10 Feature Updates Scripts

Use these scripts to manage Feature Update deployments using Windows 10 Servicing (instead of Task Sequences) and leverage all of the pre and post script functionality available.

Each file has comments/examples. I've included an Application and a Configuration Baseline that you can import to get you started.

### Blog Post
I Will be posting a blog series to go with these scripts shortly. Please check there http://www.asquaredozen.com for updates. I will go into more detail about the scripts and processes for manually building everything.
